          Normally my logging stack of choice is ELK, but recently I&rsquo;ve been digging more into Loki, designed to be the logging equivalent of Prometheus. It&rsquo;s been very interesting dealing with a low-cardinality log system after getting so used to ELK, but one feature I&rsquo;ve definitely been missing is the ability to easily add GeoIP from arbitrary logs. There&rsquo;s an open issue for adding it, but in the mean time one comment suggested using vector.

          While troubleshooting some issues on a distributed GlusterFS cluster, I came across the presence of a bunch of odd zero-byte files with empty permissions on the bricks.
132504 1 ---------T 2 1000 1000 0 Nov 28 02:09 /data/gluster/tank/brick-xxxxxxxx/brick/example/file.txt I had known they were there previously, but since the bricks were composed of ZFS zpools, there was very little danger of running out of inodes or anything, so I had let them be.

          Recently I came across a blog post explaining how to get the history of a deleted file: https://dzone.com/articles/git-getting-history-deleted, which pointed to yet another blog with the simple solution https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/querying-deleted-content-in-git/:
git log -- deleted_file.txt However, neither explained exactly why this works, and I got interested. -- is normally the convention that means &ldquo;pass everything after this into the program as a literal string. For example, if for some crazy reason you had a file named -h (which is perfectly legal), rm -h would just bring up the man page, while rm -- -h would work as expected (as would rm .

          Edit: This post has been made obsolete in recent releases, which allow enabling these flags via both the web UI and the pct CLI tool.
Normally, Proxmox doesn&rsquo;t allow mounting NFS mounts directly in containers due to security concerns. In the past it was possible to modify apparmor profiles directly in order to allow it, as seen here and here. However, as of this commit, that method is no longer an option, due to the apparmor profiles now being generated dynamically when the containers are started (you can view these profiles at /var/lib/lxc/${CID}/apparmor/lxc-${CID}_&lt;-var-lib-lxc&gt;).

          A fun little fact I discovered about SSH: when you specify a private key to use, it checks ${key}.pub for hints about how to parse the private key, without warning. Under normal operations this is never a problem, but you need to replace a private key in-place, and don&rsquo;t update the .pub file, authentication will fail:
$ ls -la ssh.key ssh.key.pub $ ssh user@host echo ping user@host&#39;s password: ^C $ mv ssh.

          While turning on jumbo frames on a basic interface is straightforward (ip link set eth0 mtu 9000), Proxmox&rsquo;s use of bridges to connect VMs makes things much more interesting. To start with, all interfaces connected to the bridge must have their MTUs upgraded first, otherwise it will give you an unhelpful error. Note that interfaces connected to the bridge include those of running containers/VMs.1

          Recently PHP 5.5 got EOL&rsquo;d, but PHP 5.6 will be supported for another two years. On Debian, this is a just a matter of upgrading the php5 package, but FreeBSD splits it out into two packages: php55 and php56, not to mention that extensions are also split out this way. The fact that I&rsquo;ve installed php via ports also complicates things.
Doing the deed This assumes portmaster is installed.

I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed using PowerDNS as my DNS server at home. Most people only think of BIND and dnsmasq when it comes to DNS, while ignoring this stable, scalable, secure database-backed offering that powers some really large deployments. But enough proselytizing! I&rsquo;m in the middle of trying to migrate my infrastructure to be controlled via Terraform (mostly).

          I&rsquo;ve been bouncing around between picking a blog platform, and realized I should really settle down and stick with one. This is mostly a page to track my decision-making, and isn&rsquo;t meant to be an objective comparison of different platforms. The one thing I'&rsquo;ll be limiting myself to is static site generators. They&rsquo;re light, easy to write to, and I can keep my blog in source control.
The markup language I&rsquo;d really rather avoid having to learn a wholle new markup, so that effectively limits me to either Markdown or ReST.

          Cron is a great tool for linux servers, but it's a very limited in it's capabilities (since it follows the Unix philosophy), so when I started to run up against those limits, I began doing all sorts of bash trickery to accomplish what I needed to happen, but that swiftly started giving me even more problem. At work, I use the Jenkins CI tool as a cron replacement (great tool, allows for distributed runs, queuing tasks, emails on failure, etc), but it seemed rather heavy weight for a homelab.
