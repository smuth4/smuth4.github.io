<p>So I one day I found myself in the market for a good web archiver. Specifically, there were some interesting open directories I wanted to mirror. My ideal solution would be a web front end around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html">wget</a>, but a little bit of research and testing showed that such an architecture would be too simplistic for the level of detail I wanted. There were a couple spider frameworks I tried out, like <a class="reference external" href="http://scrapy.org/">scrapy</a>, but I wasn't enthusiastic about the prospect of trying to roll my own solution, when I knew sites like the <a class="reference external" href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> had the exact kind of thing I had in mind, and they use the <a class="reference external" href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix">Heritrix</a> engine archive their material. The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix">Heritrix Wikipedia page</a> mentions that it can output in the same directory format as wget (perfect!), but there's no citation for that, and the Heretrix documentation is unorganized, to say the least.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-it-up">
<h2>Setting it up</h2>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>I used Heritrix 3.2.0, the most recent stable version, for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="steps">
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>This is not going to be a full tutorial on how to use Heritrix. Be sure to read the <a class="reference external" href="https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix#Heritrix-Documentation">documentation</a>, and to read the default job configuration file before starting a large job.</p>
<p>Install Heritrix as per the instructions and get it started. Navigate to the web interface and create a new job with the standard configuration.</p>
<p>Next we want to edit the disposition chain, which starts at line 335 in my default configuration. The first bean defined should be the <tt class="docutils literal">warcWriter</tt>, which, obviously, writes out scraped content to WARC files. WARC files are perfect for preserving websites exactly how they were accessed, but are a little too clumsy to be convenient.</p>
<p>After the WARC bean, add the follow code:</p>
<pre class="code xml literal-block">
<span class="name tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="name attribute">id=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;mirrorWriter&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">class=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;org.archive.modules.writer.MirrorWriterProcessor&quot;</span><span class="name tag">&gt;</span>
<span class="name tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Then, in the <tt class="docutils literal">dispositionProcessors</tt> bean, remove the line <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ref <span class="pre">bean=&quot;warcWriter&quot;/&gt;</span></tt> from the the <tt class="docutils literal">processors</tt> list, and add <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;ref <span class="pre">bean=&quot;mirrorWriter&quot;/&gt;</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That's pretty much all that's needed to get started. There are more parameters that can be tweaked, which can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="http://builds.archive.org/javadoc/heritrix-3.2.0/org/archive/modules/writer/MirrorWriterProcessor.html">3.2.0 Javadoc</a>, but the defaults are not anything surprising.</p>
