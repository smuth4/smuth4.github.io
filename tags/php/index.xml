      <description>Recently PHP 5.5 got EOL&amp;rsquo;d, but PHP 5.6 will be supported for another two years. On Debian, this is a just a matter of upgrading the php5 package, but FreeBSD splits it out into two packages: php55 and php56, not to mention that extensions are also split out this way. The fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve installed php via ports also complicates things.
Doing the deed This assumes portmaster is installed.</description>

      <title>Fun with Basic PHP Optimization</title>

      <description>A while ago I came across a full-featured PHP application for controlling a daemon. It worked well with a small data set, but quickly became laggy with a dataset numbering in the thousands. Admittedly, it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t built for that kind of load, so I removed it and controlled the daemon manually, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal.
Then a while later, I came across a post by someone who managed to mitigate the problem by shifting a particularly expensive operation to an external python program.</description>
