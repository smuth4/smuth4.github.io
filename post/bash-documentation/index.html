        <p>One of the things that always bothers me is lack of proper documentation. Now, I&rsquo;m lazy just like everyone else, but if I&rsquo;m going to document something, I prefer to do it properly and keep it up to date. I&rsquo;ve inhierited a nice suite of bash scripts, which aren&rsquo;t really complicated, but they all have the same copy &amp; pasted header that&rsquo;s dated from 2003. Not exactly helpful.</p>
<p>So while I have a wiki that explains how some of the processes work on a higher level, it would be nice to have clean documentation in my bash scripts. Ideally, it would be embeddable, exportable and human readable. Basically, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to maintain two files, I should be able to paste it somewhere else if need be, and I should be able to maintain it without any external tools whatsoever, if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Here are a list of options I found while browsing around:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old-fashioned embedded comments</li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/bashdoc">bashdoc</a> (awk + ReST structure via python&rsquo;s docutils)</li>
<li>embedded Perl POD (via a <a href="http://bahut.alma.ch/2007/08/embedding-documentation-in-shell-script_16.html">heredoc hack</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/robodoc.html">ROBODoc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these choices, POD seems a bit bloated to be inside a script, and ROBODoc looks way overblown for my simple needs, so I&rsquo;ve decided to go with bashdoc. I&rsquo;m already working with ReST, via this blog, and it fits pretty much all the criteria. Plus, it has few dependencies (awk, bash and python&rsquo;s docutils) and doesn&rsquo;t require a package for itself, so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about setting this up on production servers (although I should really set it up as a git hook in the script repo or something). However, documentation for bashdoc is quite limited (irony at it&rsquo;s finest). The best way to figure out what is going on is to read lib/basic.awk, and the docutils source code, which isn&rsquo;t exactly everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. That said, it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to build a small template I can copy and paste everywhere, which will hoepfully be more useful than the current header.</p>
