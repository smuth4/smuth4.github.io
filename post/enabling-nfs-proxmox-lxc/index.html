        <p>Edit: This post has been made obsolete in recent releases, which allow enabling these flags via both the web UI and the <code>pct</code> CLI tool.</p>
<p>Normally, Proxmox doesn&rsquo;t allow mounting NFS mounts directly in containers due to security concerns. In the past it was possible to modify apparmor profiles directly in order to allow it, as seen <a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/lxc-nfs.23763/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.svennd.be/mount-nfs-lxc-proxmox/">here</a>. However, as of <a href="https://git.proxmox.com/?p=pve-container.git;a=commit;h=5a63f1c5d3b995dd682a70e7fbd1364240e09278">this commit</a>, that method is no longer an option, due to the apparmor profiles now being generated dynamically when the containers are started (you can view these profiles at <code>/var/lib/lxc/${CID}/apparmor/lxc-${CID}_&lt;-var-lib-lxc&gt;</code>). Instead, modifying apparmor directly is no longer necessary, as you can now add the undocumented <code>feature</code> setting to the <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Manual:_pct.conf">pct.conf</a> files for individual containers. For instance:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>features: mount=nfs
</code></pre><p>allows NFS mounting for the specified container, although a restart will be necessary for the setting to take effect. You can verify this by running <code>grep nfs /var/lib/lxc/${CID}/apparmor/lxc-${CID}_\&lt;-var-lib-lxc\&gt;</code>, which return a line like <code>mount fstype=nfs</code>. Other filesystems can also be allowed by separating the different types with semicolons.</p>
<p>This change was released in version 2.0-28 of the pve-container package, so it&rsquo;s easy tell if you are affected:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ dpkg -s pve-container | grep '^Version:'
Version: 2.0-28
</code></pre><p>Since this change only applies on container start-up, it&rsquo;s possible to upgrade the package first without impacting any running containers.</p>
