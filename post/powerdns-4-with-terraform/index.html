<p>I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed using <a href="https://www.powerdns.com/">PowerDNS</a> as my DNS server at home. Most people only think of <a href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/">BIND</a> and <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">dnsmasq</a> when it comes to DNS, while ignoring this stable, scalable, secure database-backed offering that powers some really large deployments. But enough proselytizing! I&rsquo;m in the middle of trying to migrate my infrastructure to be controlled via <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> (mostly). I figure this will help me consolidate and track most of my VPSs and the like.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem<a href="#the-problem" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>PowerDNS has a nice HTTP/JSON API that can be used, but it changed URL locations in version 4, from <code>/</code> to <code>/api/v1/</code>, which makes any Terraform changes return <code>powerdns_record.dns: Failed to create PowerDNS Record: Error creating record set: exmaple.com:::A, reason: &quot;Not Found&quot;</code>, which isn&rsquo;t exactly helpful (for the record, that&rsquo;s the error message returned by the API whenever a bad URL is requested).</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Unfortunately there&rsquo;s no easy fix, short of breaking compatibility for one thing or another. However, what I decided to do was to use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx</a> as a reverse proxy for the API. My configuration looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>server {
    listen 8000;
    server_name _;

    location /api/v1/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/api/v1/;
    }
}
</code></pre><p>This lets us use both the new and old locations simultaneously. I&rsquo;m sure this can be done in Apache as well, but wasn&rsquo;t up for installing it just to test something so simple.</p>
