<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>After a hardware upgrade, I found myself with the classic setup of a high-power server on one end of a switch, and a NAS on the other. However, serving files over NFS was painfully slow. Back in the day I could have written it off as &quot;NFS sucks&quot;, but I'm potentially planning to use these datastores for VMs potentially, and with the speeds I was getting, it would get ugly very quickly. So, armed with this <a class="reference external" href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2008/slides/130-lca2008-nfs-tuning-secrets-d7.odp">very nice presentation from SGI</a>, I was ready to tackle the world.</p>

<div class="section" id="initial-testing">
<h1>Initial Testing</h1>
<p>The first thing they said was to get exact numbers and check for bottlenecks. In a real-world test, the max file transfer speed turned out to be a little more the 10mb/s. Not terrible for a network, but much less that I'll need. My disks with WD Reds in a RAID6, so I was confident the read speeds would be faster than 10mb/s, although I should really get exact numbers, at the very least to prepare for it possibly being a bottleneck later on.
However, testing the the network (using iperf), it turned out that the max network speed I could get was 94.1 Mbits (11.7 mb). ...Shit. I should've seen this coming, having only a 100Mbps switch. I could probably bring that up to 200Mbps with a little bonding magic, but I figured it was safer to future-proof, and bought a cheap gigabit switch.</p>
